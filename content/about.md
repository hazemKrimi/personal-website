## About

Hi again! So, you want to know more about me! We'll go through how I got into tech, my education and my career and some other things you might find interesting. Hopefully you enjoy reading about me and I am looking forward to chat!

### How I got into Computer Science and Software Engineering

Similar to many other software engineers stories I was fascinated by video games since childhood with the Atari, Nintendo Gameboy, N64, Game Cube and PC gaming. Some games I played when I was a kid are: Duck Hunt, Prince of Persia, IGI, Super Mario Bros (Of cource!) and many more.

### My Education

I am from Tunisia, and there you get to specialize in Computer Science early on in high school and that is exactly what I did in 2014. My first programming language was Pascal which is a similar language to Delphi. I learned the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures using Pascal, Networking fundamentals and got a little bit into webdev by the last year of high school. On my spare time, tinkered a bit with some game engines like Unity and Unreal 4 with some of my friends.

In the summer of 2018, I got more interested in web development especially with JavaScript. So, in university I went for a program that is focused on web development but I did learn other stuff like C, Java, Linux, a bit of Assembly and I got into the intecacies of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.

The university program was mostly packed with the fundamentals but none of the technologies of today's world. So, I did a lot of learning by myself through small practice projects and participating in hackathons. Most of the technologies I work with today I learned by myself including: React.js and React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, MongoDB...

### My Career

I started my career as a Front End developer in a software agency in Tunisia called [EMIKETIC](https://www.emiketic.com) building mostly e-commerce websites for small to medium businesses and sometimes on custom solutions for clients. There I got to learn Next.js, Strapi and especially how to work effectively in a team environment where I got to hone my communication and collaboration skills.

Then I started working remotely in a company based in the UK called [Cielo Costa](https://cielocosta.com) which is all about providing custom solutions to improves internal business processes.

Afterwards, I started working at [Finteum](https://finteum.com) which is creating a global financial market for intraday liquidity, enabling interbank lending for hours at a time.

Currently, I am working at [ProveAI](https://proveai.com) which is creating a platform for AI management that helps organizations centralize and manage their AI models while maintaining strict oversight of data access and usage.

### My Hobbies

Even though I didn't pursue Game Development, I am still a gamer but I don't play that much anymore. Currently, I am more into Cycling, reading Mangas, Personal Development books and Computer Science related books. I also play [Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/hazemkrimi) and card games.
